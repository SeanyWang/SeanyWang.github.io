          I am a <a href="https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/users/swang">Research Scholar and IT Project Manager</a> at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, where I manage and support select digital infrastructure collaborations in <a href="http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/dept-three">Department III: "Artefacts, Action, Knowledge."</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a PhD Candidate in Geography and Women's & Gender Studies at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu">Maxwell School of Syracuse University</a>. My advisor is urban and cultural geographer <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/Winders,_Jamie/">Jamie Winders</a>, who is an expert on immigration politics in the United States.

          My <a href="http://scholar.syr.edu/scholars/2015-16/wang.html">dissertation</a> explores contemporary practices of Chinese birth tourism and investigates their cultural and political significances in multiple locales across the Pacific. I do so through various qualitative methods from humanities and social sciences, including ethnography, policy and textual analyses, visual methods, and personal memoirs.

          I studied for an <a href="http://surface.syr.edu/thesis/12/">MA in Geography (2013)</a> at the same institution, where I was supervised by Marxist cultural geographer <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/Mitchell,_Don/">Don Mitchell</a> (now at Uppsala University in Sweden). I hold a <a href="https://geography.washington.edu/news/2016/08/23/geography-alum-helps-unearth-wealth-orca-card-data">BA in Geography (2011)</a> from the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> as well.
