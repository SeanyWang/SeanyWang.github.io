          I am a Project Manager and Research Scholar at the <a href="https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for the History of Science</a>, where I coordinate the <a href="https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/projects/departmentSchaefer_DigitalHumanityResearch">Digital Infrastructure</a> collaboration in Department III.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I am also a PhD Candidate in Geography and Women's & Gender Studies at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/">Maxwell School of Syracuse University</a>. My advisor is urban and cultural geographer <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/Winders,_Jamie/">Professor Jamie Winders</a>, who is an expert on immigration politics in the United States.

        <p>
          My <a href="http://scholar.syr.edu/scholars/2015-16/wang.html">dissertation</a> is a comparative political ethnography of Chinese birth tourism in Hong Kong and southern California, where differing geopolitical contexts, immigration histories, and regional racial formations produced divergent local responses to the phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied for an <a href="http://surface.syr.edu/thesis/12/">MA in Geography (2013)</a> at the same institution, where I was supervised by Marxist cultural geographer <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/Mitchell,_Don/">Professor Don Mitchell</a> (now at Uppsala University in Sweden). I hold a <a href="https://geography.washington.edu/news/2016/08/23/geography-alum-helps-unearth-wealth-orca-card-data">BA in Geography (2011)</a> from the <a href="https://geography.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> as well.
