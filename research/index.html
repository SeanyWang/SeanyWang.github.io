        A broadly trained human geographer, my primary research interests include citizenship, family, sexuality, and ethnic studies.
        I am experienced in various qualitative and quantitative research methods, and I have a strong interest in mixed-method research design.
        Besides work related to my dissertation research, I have published on topics such as gayborhoods in Seattle, queer foster and adoptive parents in New York state, and gender studies in South Africa.
        I am also involved in many collaborations, including projects on legal geographies of US citizenship in the Asia-Pacific with <a href="https://syr.academia.edu/EmilyMitchellEaton">Emily Mitchell-Eaton</a>, China's socioeconomic transformations and southern geographical theory with <a href="http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/pol/faculty_academic_teaching_detail.asp?id=64">He Wang</a>, and public transit equity with researchers affiliated with the <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2016/">eScience Institute</a>at the University of Washington.
