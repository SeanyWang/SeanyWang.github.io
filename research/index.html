      <p>
        I am a broadly trained social scientist with expertise in human geography, social theory, demography, and data science.
        My primary research interests are the political and cultural geographies of citizenship, migration, and families.
        In addition, I have done research in Asian area and diaspora studies, feminist and queer theories, transportation and mobility studies, and the history of geography and geographic thought.
        I am experienced in various qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial research methods, and I have a strong interest in mixed-method research design.
