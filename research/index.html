    <p> A broadly trained human geographer, my primary research interests
      include citizenship, family, sexuality, and ethnic studies. I am
      experienced in various qualitative and quantitative research methods,
      and I have a strong interest in mixed-method research design. Besides
      work related to my dissertation research, I have published on topics
      such as gayborhoods in Seattle, queer foster and adoptive parents in
      New York state, and gender studies in South Africa. I am also involved
      in many collaborations, including projects on legal geographies of US
      citizenship in the Asia-Pacific with <a href=
